	The user can then enter the type of food the vendor serves i.e., BBQ, American, Japanese.
	Then the user is able to enter a rating of the food truck vendor on a 1 to 5 scale.
	                   --Maximum of 5 Food Trucks can be entered--
	The user is then able to choose from a list of menu items that include:

### Technology Used
	The technology utilized during production of Food Truck Application includes:
		MacOS, Eclipse IDE - JavaSE-1.8, Atom, Zoom, Slack, and gitHub.
### Lessons Learned
	Object Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming -  provided the necessary framework
	for developing a functioning application.  I found that is was much easier to translate 
	plan language into code, once I got my ideas down on paper.  I also reinforced the use 
	of all available resources includes peer programming, and use of instructional staff.
