### Lessons Learned
	Object Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming -  provided the necessary framework
	for developing a functioning application.  I found that is was much easier to translate 
	plan language into code, once I got my ideas down on paper.  I also reinforced the use 
	of all available resources includes peer programming, and use of instructional staff.
